    "## What is Symmetric Cryptography?\n",
    "\n",
    "Symmetric cryptography, also known as secret-key cryptography, is a method of encryption where the same key is used for both the encryption and decryption processes. It is one of the oldest and most widely used forms of cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "In symmetric cryptography, the sender and the receiver share a secret key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. This key must be kept confidential to ensure the security of the communication."

    "## How Does Symmetric Cryptography Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encryption**: The sender uses the shared secret key to encrypt the plaintext message into ciphertext. This process involves applying a mathematical algorithm to transform the original message into an unreadable form.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transmission**: The encrypted ciphertext is transmitted over an insecure channel, such as the internet or a wireless network.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decryption**: The receiver uses the same shared secret key to decrypt the ciphertext back into the original plaintext message. This process involves applying the inverse of the encryption algorithm to reverse the transformation."

    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that replaced DES. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, making it more secure than DES.\n",

    "3. **Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)**: 3DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that applies DES three times with different keys. It provides a higher level of security than DES but is slower due to the multiple encryption rounds.\n"
