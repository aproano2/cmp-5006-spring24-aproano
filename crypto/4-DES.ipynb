    "### History\n",
    "\n",
    "- DES is an outdated symmetric key method of data encryption. \n",
    "- It was adopted in 1977 for government agencies to protect sensitive data and was officially retired in 2005.\n",
    "- IBM researchers originally designed the standard in the early 1970s. \n",
    "- DES was the first encryption algorithm the U.S. government approved for public disclosure. \n",
    "- Quickly adopted by industries, such as financial services, that needed strong encryption. "

    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Block cipher:** The DES is a block cipher,in which the cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to a block of data simultaneously rather than one bit at a time. Blocksie for DES is 64-bit. Each block is enciphered using the secret key into a 64-bit ciphertext by means of permutation and substitution.\n",
    "- **Several rounds of encryption:** The DES process involves encrypting 16 times. It can run in four different modes, encrypting blocks individually or making each cipher block dependent on all the previous blocks. Decryption is simply the inverse of encryption, following the same steps but reversing the order in which the keys are applied.\n",
    "- **64-bit key:** The DES uses a 64-bit key, but 8 of those bits are used for parity checks. The effective key length is only 56 bits. The encryption algorithm generates 16 different 48-bit subkeys, one for each of the 16 encryption rounds. Subkeys are generated by selecting and permuting parts of the key.\n",
    "- **Substitution and permutation:** The algorithm defines sequences of substitution and permutation that the ciphertext undergoes during the encryption process.\n"
